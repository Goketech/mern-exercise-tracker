You may also see any lint errors in the console.



In the backend directory, you can run:

### `nodemon server`

This route receives a post request: [http://localhost:5000/exercises/add](http://localhost:5000/exercises/add) to add exercises to server.
There are many other routes like edit, delete, add users and more.
